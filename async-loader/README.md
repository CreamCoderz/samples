===============================================

This sample app demonstrates how packages how RaptorJS modules/packages can
be loaded asynchronously.

To view the full documentation for this sample please see [RaptorJS: Packaging](http://raptorjs.org/module-loader/get-started-async/).

## Run Sample

### Build Steps
1. npm install
2. node build.js

After running the above steps the optimized resource bundles will be written to "build/static" and 
the optimized HTML page will be written to "build/index.html". The generated index.html page can be loaded
into your browser to view the working demo.
